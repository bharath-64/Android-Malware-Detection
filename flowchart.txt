1. Importing the packages
2. Exploring the dataset - APK feature Data
3. Data processing
	- Using Pandas Dataframe
4. Visualization using seaborn & matplotlib
	- Based on different Column Data
5. Label Processing
	- Label Encoder from object to int
6. Feature Selection 
	- Appending the Data to X_train and y_train
7. Data Splitting to train and test
8. Building the model
	- Logistic Regression
	- KNN
	- SVM
	- Decision Tree
	- Random Forest
	- NN

9. Training and Building the model 

9. Flask Framework with Sqlite for signup and signin
10. Importing the packages
11. User gives input
12. The given input is preprocessed for prediction
13. Trained model is used for prediction
14. Final outcome is displayed through frontend

Extension
----------
In the base paper the author mentions to following models like SVM, LR, RF, KNN
And DT for analysis the dataset, SVM got 88%
As extension we are going to apply NN  for analysis the dataset,  we got 92%
Along with that we provide frontend for analysis and prediction of user input.
